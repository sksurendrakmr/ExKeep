# ExKeep
A react-native app to keep track of personal daily expenses and view the expenses summary

Currently, there exists an inefficient process for store employees to report operational issues encountered during tasks such as credit applications, profile creation, and conversion to pro memberships. The current workflow necessitates reporting issues to store managers, who then navigate various channels to relay the problem to the appropriate product teams. Consequently, it takes approximately 3-4 days to communicate the issue to the relevant domain team and an additional 5-6 days to ascertain the root cause.

By the time the issue reaches the appropriate domain team, essential details such as the occurrence date, user email, and operational flow are often lacking, hindering swift resolution by developers.

To address this challenge, there is a need to establish a streamlined system that enables real-time reporting of bugs by store employees with comprehensive information. This system should facilitate direct notification to the domain team upon issue reporting, thus expediting the identification and resolution process.

This problem statement outlines the current inefficiencies and proposes a solution-oriented approach to address the gap between store employees and domain teams in reporting and resolving operational issues.
